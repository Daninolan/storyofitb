		<p class="lefty2">When we talk about history we often try to remember the good times but today were here to talk about all the times, that being said lets talk about when CDM started back in 2009 was when the module was created and over the years a lot has changed with the module, to the right you can see how much the modules have changed, the left side is 2009 and the right side is 2018, as you can see so much has changed, the course used to have visual language but it also as you can see some of it is still fairly similar like web devlopment, the course has brought out a lot in students over the years as i had the privlage of meeting one who was in 2nd year when i met her so it would of been about 6 years ago she started making her one of the first to start in the college, her name was dawn, and the course was very different back then, she made it sound like it had a lot to offer which as you can see it does.</p>

		<p class="lefty2">Some of the other things that have changed over the years is the level of students who used to be only 20 but now are over 100s of students, some you can see at work in 2018, history is being made every day for CDM, but While many of the college lectures have thought students in CDM over the years and some of them have changed, one of them who hasnt is Margaret Kinsella who is Course Coordinator for cdm yr 1 students, i did an interview with her if you wish to check it out to learn her personal opinion of CDM.
