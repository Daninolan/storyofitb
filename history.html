		<p class="lefty2">In the history of ITB so much has happened, first was when the campus was first opened back in 1999 the concrete flooring was not dry 100% when students came into the college, they had industrial fans trying to get the floor in time for students to arrive, the first website was so challenging, it took them a lot of work and working on the logo was hard too as they took a while to get the colours right, this was a lot of work as social media didn’t come around properly till 2004. Most of the stuff happened in the linc building where all the stuff went on, it was the 2nd building made after the A block which was the first, here’s a map of the college years ago as it was build and one where it was almost finished.

		<p class="lefty2">In 2006 the college got a dedicated marketing unit to help push the college out more so more students would come, a lot of this was done through social media like bebo and facebook. In 2009 CDM course was offically launched, this brought in a lot more students
In 2012 TU Dublin talks started to make legislation to form in THS, but the government fell and nothing happened for 4 years, then 2.5 years later the t-shuck decided to call for a merger of ITB/DIT/ITT to form TU Dublin, this would make the first TU in Ireland. The official but old site for the college used to be called www.itb/cao which was the offical site for the campus at the time, the official site for the campus could have been in the blanchardstown shopping centre near the draeocht, the primary industry at the time was red dog, the college is still doing well to this day and will officially become TU Dublin in January 2019.</p>
