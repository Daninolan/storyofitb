        <h3 class="web">interview with Margaret Kinsella</h3> <br>   
		<p class="lefty2"><h3>What is your title and how would you describe what you do at ITB?</h3>
Lecturer in Informatics<br>
Course Coordinator cdm yr 1<br>
involved in civic engagement and industry creative innovations<br>
building authentic e-portfolio entries<br>
Running Annual DELL Debate<br>
Universal Design Champion<br><br>
<h3>What has been your experience of CDM and or ITB since you started working here?</h3>
Extremely positive, fantastic to work in a campus environment, forward thinking and student centred<br><br>
<h3>how has CDM changed over the years and how have students reacted to the changes?</h3>
mission statement has always included a diversity statement so while we are approaching Technological University with diversity at the heart in my experience this has always been the scenario<br><br>
<h3>Do you feel the college has kept up with today's current view on CDM as a whole?</h3>
Programmatic review is held every five years however cdm always increments each module as changes see it.  Industry panels inform programmatic review.  Work placement in year three inform module delivery also.  Strong links with graduates and this is the third strand where itb cdm can see the roles and responsibilities of graduates and make changes accordingly.<br><br>
<h3>How has it been teaching students in the CDM module?</h3>
Very enjoyable and a pleasure, really well motivated students and interested in their career choice<br><br>
<h3>If You could change anything about CDM what would it be and why?</h3>
Provide more day time part time course options.<br><br>
<h3>What would you say your greatest achievement has been while working at itb?</h3>
Involving every first year in a creative innovative project every year for the last decade.<br><br>
<h3>Is there anything you dislike about the college?</h3>
apcoa car clamping!<br><br>
<h3>What advice would you give a student who is struggling in the college?</h3>
Attend, attend, attend, participate, participate, participate, talk to course coordinator and talk to all their lecturers.  Speak to other students.  Decide then is the course for them.  Is it their interest level?  In other words are they struggling because they are overwhelmed with the work and maybe slipped into a pattern of non attendance or are they struggling with the course as a career choice.</p>
